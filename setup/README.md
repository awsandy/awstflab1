## Setup

### AWS Account

In order to complete this workshop, you'll need an AWS account and access to
create AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), VPC, Subnets , EC2 and Kubernetes
, and AWS Cloud9 resources within that account.

The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one participant is using
a given AWS account at a time. If you attempt sharing an account with another
participant, you will encounter naming conflicts for certain resources. You can
work around this by either using a suffix in your resource names or using
distinct Regions, but the instructions do not provide details on the changes
required to make this work.

Use a personal account or create a new AWS account for this workshop rather than
using an organization's account to ensure you have full access to the necessary
services and to ensure you do not leave behind any resources from the workshop.

### AWS Cloud9 IDE

AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets
you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code
editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools
for popular programming languages and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
pre-installed so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for
this workshop. Your Cloud9 environment will have access to the same AWS
resources as the user with which you logged into the AWS Management Console.

Take a moment now and setup your Cloud9 development environment.

**:white_check_mark: Step-by-step Instructions**

1. Go to the AWS Management Console, click **Services** then select **Cloud9**
   under Developer Tools.

1. Click **Create environment**.

1. Enter `Development` into **Name** and optionally provide a **Description**.

1. Click **Next step**.

1. You may leave **Environment settings** at their defaults apart form instance type
   select "Other Instance type" and select **t3.micro** 
   Note by default this will be paused after **30 minutes** of inactivity.

2. Click **Next step**.

3. Review the environment settings and click **Create environment**. It will
   take several minutes for your environment to be provisioned and prepared.

4. Once ready, your IDE will open to a welcome screen. Below that, you should
   see a terminal prompt.

    You can run AWS CLI commands in here just like you would on your local computer.
    Verify that your user is logged in by running `aws sts get-caller-identity`.

    ```console
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```

    You'll see output indicating your account and user information:

    ```console
    ec2-user:~/environment $ aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```
    ```json
    {
        "Account": "123456789012",
        "UserId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
    }
    ```

Keep your AWS Cloud9 IDE opened in a tab throughout this workshop.

### :star: Tips

:bulb: Keep an open scratch pad in Cloud9 or a text editor on your local computer
for notes.  When the step-by-step directions tell you to note something such as
an ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN), copy and paste that into the scratch pad.

### :star: Recap

:key: Use a unique personal or development [AWS account](#aws-account)

:key: Keep your [AWS Cloud9 IDE](#aws-cloud9-ide) opened in a tab
